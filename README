Datatype 
--------
Prepared statement is used in all queries so it is important in all queries. 
Datatypes are searched based on any field definition on a certain page in which the query 
is defined.
Logic:
1. `select NAME txtmyname from USERS where EMPID=:txtempid|STRING`. 
In this the datatype is appended inline in the expression. This overrides the **dbdatatype** 
attribute shown below. 
2. `select NAME txtmyname from USERS where EMPID=:txtempid`.
In this **:txtempid** is searched in all fields in a page with **forid=txtempid**. If found the 
dbdatatype attribute is used to get its data type.
3. The last word in the expression is used to search in **forid=<last segment in expression>**
eg. In expression :vs.form1[0].txtempid, txtempid will be used to search **forid=txtempid**.
The txtmyname's datatype is ignored and no conversion is performed.
and pushed on result map like **txtyname=<value>**. 

Query Parameter evaluation
--------------------------
There are 4 types of evaluating query paramters.
1. :inp.form1[0].txtempid - Ognl expression is evaluated agaist input data in inputDTO
2. :res.form1[0].txtempid - Ognl expression is evaluated agaist result evaluated previously in 
current request scope.
3. :vs.form1[0].txtempid - vs means value stack. Ognl expression is evaluated against
 `ValueStack`. 
4. :ses.form1[0].txtempid - Session data, this must have an entry in the page xml so that it gets sent to backend
 `ValueStack`. 
5. :txtempid - Is evaluated from current record json object.


arbitrary variables can be passes through inputDTO in any key, value pair except for 
sessionvars, txnrec, bulkcmd.
if bulkcmd is defined: it is processed as single command.
if bulkcmd is null or inline then each record is parsed for command (inline). if found it is used to match with 
//cmd[@name='xxx']  and do respective command processor.
The form data must start with "form" eg. form1, form2 ...

InputDTO has 
PaginationDTO is used for jqgrid.
ResultDTO also has pagination fields.


 rules: {
     name: "required",
     email: {
       required: true,
       email: true
     }
   },
   messages: {
     name: "Please specify your name",
     email: {
       required: "We need your email address to contact you",
       email: "Your email address must be in the format of name@domain.com"
     }
   }

The ResultDTO will also contain the session variables that needs to be set at the end of this request. Like storing User Name, session_id,
Role, Menu.
