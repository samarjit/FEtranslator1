Datatype 
--------
Prepared statement is used in all queries so it is important in all queries. 
Datatypes are searched based on any field definition on a certain page in which the query 
is defined.
Logic:
1. `select NAME txtmyname from USERS where EMPID=:txtempid|STRING`. 
In this the datatype is appended inline in the expression. This overrides the **dbdatatype** 
attribute shown below. 
2. `select NAME txtmyname from USERS where EMPID=:txtempid`.
In this **:txtempid** is searched in all fields in a page with **forid=txtempid**. If found the 
dbdatatype attribute is used to get its data type.
3. The last word in the expression is used to search in **forid=<last segment in expression>**
eg. In expression :vs.form1[0].txtempid, txtempid will be used to search **forid=txtempid**.
The txtmyname's datatype is ignored and no conversion is performed.
and pushed on result map like **txtyname=<value>**. 

Query Parameter evaluation
--------------------------
There are 4 types of evaluating query paramters.
1. :inp.form1[0].txtempid - Ognl expression is evaluated agaist input data in inputDTO
2. :res.form1[0].txtempid - Ognl expression is evaluated agaist result evaluated previously in 
current request scope.
3. :vs.form1[0].txtempid - vs means value stack. Ognl expression is evaluated against
 `ValueStack`. 
4. :txtempid - Is evaluated from current record json object.
